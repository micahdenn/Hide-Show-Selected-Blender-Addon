# Hide/Show Selected 
Little blender addon I made whilst working on [The Royals Next Door](https://pikkukala.com/royals-next-door/)

Enables (or disables) the visibility of all selected objects in render and sets a key frame for them.

*This was written fast and dirty because we needed it and it might crash if you try to hide objects that are already hidden or vice versa *
